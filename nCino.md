**Landscape**
-------------

-   Financial Services Industry

With in excess of 28,000 monetary organizations around the world,
banking is one of the biggest and most complex businesses in the
worldwide economy and is described by serious rivalry between
officeholder monetary foundations and Fintechs entering banking space.
The serious scene under high administrative oversight present a defense
for information driven dynamic and mechanization.

Besides, web-based media, portable infiltration and online business are
moving monetary foundations to draw in with customers and workers all
the more effectively, shrewdly, and straightforwardly through new
channels. Reacting to these patterns, numerous monetary establishments
have set out on advanced changes, putting resources into innovation to
make their activities more customer engaged, mechanized and dexterous
with numerous monetary foundations are going above and beyond by
embracing present day prescient investigation and AI/ML to turn out to
be all the more really information driven associations.

-   A Seamless experience for customers

> Customer hopes to associate with a monetary establishment in a
> intelligent manners where connection is smooth, predictable and esteem
> added across banking channels.
>
> As per a 2019 PwC study, there has been a 21% expansion since 2015 in
> customers who utilize monetary foundations that place more
> significance on experiential elements than loan fees. Moreover, this
> overview takes note of that 35% of customers pick their monetary
> establishment dependent on usability and customer administration.
>
> Monetary establishments, which have truly expected customers to adjust
> to the organization\'s working structure, should progressively adjust
> their working structures to the requirements of their customers. This
> change requires an adaptable, versatile, lithe and secure innovation
> stage. As per a 2018 Accenture overview, 74% of bank activity pioneers
> state that customer experience is their top vital need, yet 69% accept
> they are not streamlining their information and abilities to improve
> the customer venture, with inheritance conditions most often referred
> to as the best obstruction to change.

-   High spending on Digital Transformation by financial institutions

> Monetary establishments spend more on innovation than some other
> industry and computerized change is relied upon to quicken this
> pattern. As indicated by a 2018 EY review, 85% of banks are as of now
> attempted advanced changes to modernize their organizations and 60% of
> banks intend to build their innovation financial plans by at any rate
> 10% throughout the following a year.
>
> While distributed computing is a key empowering agent of computerized
> change, monetary organizations have generally been delayed to embrace
> distributed computing out of worries over steadiness, security and
> control. Thus, monetary foundations are commonly in the beginning
> phases of their progress to the cloud, and getting to a profoundly
> dependable and secure stage for day in and day out/365 \"anyplace\"

-   Financial Institutions Face Increased Regulatory Scrutiny

-   Major trends in that industry focusing on automation and data-driven
    banking

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
-   Automation. Financial institutions are marrying digital technologies
    and data to modernize and automate what were traditionally manual
    processes. The automation opportunity is an institution-wide mandate
    where dynamic data models are increasingly being used to monitor
    business processes and automate tasks and decisions to drive
    organizational efficiency, scalability and speed.

-   Actionable Intelligence. Actionable intelligence technology offers
    the ability to synthesize disparate data sets into unified
    reportable information and provides a recommended course of action
    to make more informed real-time decisions.

-   Predictive Analytics. Predictive analytics use cases in financial
    services include predicting fraud, modeling risk, personalizing
    marketing, predicting client lifetime value, segmenting clients,
    enabling recommendation engines, predicting loan defaults and
    improving client support. The financial and operational benefits of
    these use cases can be substantial. For example, a 2018 McKinsey
    report estimated that successful implementations of
    "next-product-to-buy" recommendation engines within the financial
    services industry have resulted in an increase of more than 50% in
    the number of leads offered per client and as many as 6 out of 10
    clients purchasing a new product in response to a sales call.

-   AI/ML. Artificial intelligence makes it possible for machines to
    perform human-like tasks and analyses. Machine learning is an
    application of artificial intelligence that allows systems to
    automatically learn and improve their algorithms without being
    explicitly programmed. AI/ML can be used to continually improve
    operating results by, for example, modeling credit exposure and
    estimating the impact of a downturn on a financial institution's
    portfolios. Other AI/ML use cases in financial services include
    streamlining credit decisions, preventing fraud and providing
    personalized services. According to a 2018 Accenture report, AI/ML
    will allow banks to save 20% to 25% across IT operations,
    infrastructure, maintenance and operations.

-   Competition

> The primary competition for nCino has historically been point solution
> vendors and, to a lesser extent, systems internally developed by
> financial institutions. nCino marks their core banking system
> platform, deep banking domain expertise, professional service
> standards, and customer support distinguish it from its competition.
>
> Likely success factors include:

-   breadth and depth of functionality in its platform,

-   ease of deployment, implementation, and user interface,

-   cloud-based technology platform and pricing model,

-   customer support services,

-   capability for configurability, integration and scalability,

-   security and reliability,

-   ability of platform to support compliance with legal and regulatory
    requirements,

-   ability to integrate with third-party applications and systems.

> Key competitors include the following who offer digital banking
> platforms:

> Key risk being faced by nCino digital banking platform:

-   Pe-dominantly cloud-based system and If the market for cloud-based
    banking technology develops more slowly then expected or changes in
    a way that bring major shift to technology, it could impact nCino
    platform,

-   Security breach into digital banking platform system resulting in
    unauthorized access to customer or their clients' data,

-   nCino delivery of digital banking platform is heavily reliant on
    salesforce platform and their agreement with Salesforce to provide
    our solution to nCino customers

-   Privacy and data security concerns, data collection and transfer
    restrictions and related domestic or foreign regulations may limit
    the use and adoption of the nCino Bank Operating System,

-   Heavily reliant on financial services industry and any technological
    shift in this particular industry may heavily impact technological
    infrastructure of nCino.

-   nCino mostly leverage third-party software, content and services for
    their solution that is integrated with licensed third-party software
    services and any failure in the chain of services could cause
    delays, errors, or failures of their solution.

-   nCino use "open source" software in their solution that could
    restrict on how they can distribute their solutions and may be
    required to release source code of certain software subject to open
    source licenses

**Recommendations**
-------------------

> nCino started with a great promise on digitization of banking platform
> that was much needed in the highly regulated financial institution
> space to address the pain points suffered by customers dealing with
> financial institutions, stakeholders that deal with financial
> institutions and employee of the financial institutions.
>
> Having taken a giant leap in the right direction, it seems that could
> have lost path in disrupting the financial services industry and
> rather became partners with legacy banking system to help them to
> overhaul their operations by digitizing it through offering service as
> SaaS that could still be a valid business model which carries its own
> set of risk when relying on third party software providers including
> Salesforce and other third party software providers. nCino has become
> more like a backward integration of Salesfoce platform with their
> investment in nCino and heavy support to nCino platform.
>
> With a fully digital banking operation of nCino, it would have great
> capability to establish in Fintech league financial service providers
> that can establish it s own direction and compete with future Fintechs
> in financial services and evolve its technology offering in line with
> new trends. With currently anchored as service providers to legacy
> banking system and through their direct and in direct investments into
> nCino platform, it is much reliant on the existing financial services
> providers to guide its future technology path and not disrupt the
> existing financial services sector.

I would have advised them of the following:

-   Offer their service as a fully digital bank to provide banking as
    platform, as a service and payments as a service disrupting the
    legacy financial services providers and bring fee structure lower
    for the customers and expand width, depth and consistency of
    financial services,

-   To develop proprietary cloud-banking solutions and have less
    reliance on third party service providers through organic growth and
    technology acquisition,

-   Use of blockchain technology at the backend in providing financial
    services solution to complete with crowdfunding, payment solution
    and other innovative financial services models that legacy banking
    system can not compete with their existing business models,
